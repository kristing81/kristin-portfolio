Hi, I'm Kristin an aspiring Ruby on Rails developer/ninja/wizard.  I'm a grad from a  Full Stack Web Development Apprenticeship program and still in my first year of coding!

I’m looking for an opportunity where I can continue to grow as a developer, contribute my skills in a meaningful way and spread some good. 


## Some things I play with

* Ruby on Rails/Ruby 
* Javascript/jQuery 
* HTML/XHTML/HAML
* CSS/Bootstrap 
* MySQL/NoSQL/PostgreSQL
* Git/Github

When I'm not with my computer ... I'm probably in the kitchen, on my yoga mat, or exploring my current city (last time I checked it was Hong Kong)
